Description: 
    Combining genomic prediction with Monte Carlo simulation, three different 
    strategies are implemented to select parental lines for multiple traits in plant 
    breeding. The selection strategies include (i) GEBV-O considers only genomic 
    estimated breeding values (GEBVs) of the candidate individuals; (ii) GD-O 
    considers only genomic diversity (GD) of the candidate individuals; and (iii) 
    GEBV-GD considers both GEBV and GD. The above method can be seen in Chung PY, 
    Liao CT (2020) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0243159>. Multi-trait genomic best 
    linear unbiased prediction (MT-GBLUP) model is used to simultaneously estimate 
    GEBVs of the target traits, and then a selection index is adopted to evaluate 
    the composite performance of an individual.
